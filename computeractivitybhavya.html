<p>The sarangi, not only in Hindustani classical music, but also in folk music, is the only instrument which comes in closest proximity to the human voice. Many forms of this are in vogue in different regions of our country, but ironically, its place and time of origin have not been established as yet.

The sarangi is the only instrument which can produce almost all the nuances of vocal music of any style, be it dhrupad, khayal, thumri, tappa or bhajan or even ghazal, with exact embellishments and intonations. That is why this Instrument has always remained in close association with vocal music, and has always been preferred by vocalists as an able accompaniment.It is a famous instrument of LUCKNOW.</p>

<p>Khartal, also known as kartal or khar taal, is an idiophone percussion instrument originating in Rajasthan, India. It is classified as an idiophone because the entire instrument vibrates to produce a sound on it’s own. Still incredibly popular throughout India, particularly in the UP AND RAJASTHAN. A common accompaniment to folk and devotional music, the khartal is one of the smallest, and oldest, percussion instruments in the world. Khartal is also a popular rhythm accompaniment to tabla and harmonium.</p>
